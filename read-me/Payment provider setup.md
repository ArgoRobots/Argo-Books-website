# Payment Provider Setup

Full setup for Stripe, PayPal, and Square — both the **payment portal** and the **SaaS subscription billing**.

Each provider has two completely separate apps: **sandbox** and **live**.
They have separate client IDs, secrets, webhook IDs, and redirect-URI
allowlists. Configuring one does not carry over to the other. Repeat
every step below twice — once per environment.

The website is environment-switched by `APP_ENV` in `.env`:

```
APP_ENV=sandbox       # uses sandbox keys and URLs
APP_ENV=production    # uses live keys and URLs
```

And `SITE_URL` controls what host is sent as `redirect_uri` to each
provider, which is matched against the allowlists below:

```
# sandbox
SITE_URL=https://dev.argorobots.com

# production
SITE_URL=https://argorobots.com
```

## What each provider handles

For all three providers, the website uses the same three integration
points. Provider-specific quirks are called out in the respective
sections below.

1. **Portal Connect** — Argo Books desktop users authorize the website
   to receive invoice payments through their own provider account
   (OAuth / Connect onboarding).
2. **Portal payment webhooks** — backup confirmation when a portal
   invoice captures or refunds. The primary path is synchronous via
   `process-payment.php`; the webhook covers the case where the customer
   closes their browser before the success page loads.
3. **SaaS subscription billing** — argorobots.com customers paying for
   Argo Premium subscriptions.

---

## Stripe

The portal Connect flow uses Stripe Connect Express. Stripe Account Links generate
one-time onboarding URLs, so there's **no redirect-URI allowlist** to
maintain (unlike PayPal / Square). Subscription billing goes through
Stripe Checkout / Subscriptions.

### A. Create / enable the platform account

1. Sign in at https://dashboard.stripe.com.
2. Click the account name in the top-left of the dashboard. For sandbox
   setup, click **Switch to sandbox** and pick a sandbox (or create one
   via **Manage sandboxes**). For live setup, click **Exit sandbox**.
   The dashboard reloads in the chosen environment — every step below
   must be repeated once per environment.
3. Open **Developers > API keys** (easiest way: type "API keys" into the top search
   bar.
   Copy the publishable and secret keys into `.env`:
   ```
   STRIPE_SANDBOX_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_...
   STRIPE_SANDBOX_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_...
   STRIPE_LIVE_SECRET_KEY=sk_live_...
   STRIPE_LIVE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_live_...
   ```

### B. Enable Connect (portal Connect)

1. Search "Connect onboarding options" in the top search bar, or go
   directly to **Settings -> Connect -> Onboarding options**. If that page
   loads, Connect is already enabled on the account.
2. **Countries** — click **Select all** in the top-right.
3. No redirect URLs to whitelist — the server creates one-time onboarding
   URLs via Stripe Account Links.
4. Search "Express Dashboard" in the top search bar, or go directly to **Settings -> Connect -> Express Dashboard**. Enter "Argo Books' for the name, and select the Argo Books logo.

### C. Portal payment webhook

In the Stripe Dashboard (Test mode for sandbox, Live mode for live):

1. Search "Webhooks" in the top search bar and click "ADd destintation.
2. **Endpoint URL:**
   - Sandbox: `https://dev.argorobots.com/api/portal/webhooks/stripe`
   - Live:    `https://argorobots.com/api/portal/webhooks/stripe`
3. **Events to send:**
   - `payment_intent.succeeded`
   - `charge.refunded`
4. After creating, click into the endpoint and reveal the
   **Destination ID** (`whsec_...`). Copy into `.env`:
   ```
   STRIPE_SANDBOX_PORTAL_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_...
   STRIPE_LIVE_PORTAL_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_...
   ```

### D. SaaS subscription billing

Nothing to set up — `cron/subscription_renewal.php` handles renewals against the stored PaymentMethod, using prices from `config/pricing.php`.

---

## PayPal

The portal Connect flow uses "Log in with PayPal" (`signin/authorize` with `scope=openid email`). Subscription billing goes through PayPal Subscriptions; Plan records live in PayPal and the site stores their IDs.

### A. Create the apps

Do this once per environment.

1. Sandbox: https://developer.paypal.com/dashboard/applications/sandbox
2. Live:    https://developer.paypal.com/dashboard/applications/live
3. **Create App** -> name it (Any name is fine. You can choose "Argo Books"), choose **Merchant**, pick a sandbox business account on the sandbox side.
4. Note down the **Client ID** and **Secret** and put them in `.env`:
   ```
   PAYPAL_SANDBOX_CLIENT_ID=...
   PAYPAL_SANDBOX_CLIENT_SECRET=...
   PAYPAL_LIVE_CLIENT_ID=...
   PAYPAL_LIVE_CLIENT_SECRET=...
   ```

### B. Enable "Log in with PayPal" (payment portal)

Click on each app then:

1. Scroll to the **Features** section.
2. Check **Log in with PayPal**.
3. Click **Manage** under that checkbox.
4. Under **Return URL**, add the redirect that matches that app's
   environment:
   - Sandbox app: `https://dev.argorobots.com/api/portal/connect/callback/paypal`
   - Live app:    `https://argorobots.com/api/portal/connect/callback/paypal`
5. Under **Information requested from customers**, check:
   - Full Name
   - Email
6. Fill in **Privacy Policy URL** and **User Agreement URL** (use the existing argorobots.com legal pages).
7. **Save** at the bottom of the sub-form.

### C. Subscription plans (SaaS billing)

PayPal needs Plan records to exist before the site can sell Premium subscriptions through it. A CLI script creates them via the PayPal API:

```
php webhooks/setup-paypal-plans.php
```

It uses `APP_ENV` to decide whether to create plans in sandbox or live PayPal, so it must be run **twice** — once with `APP_ENV=sandbox` to create the sandbox plans, and again with `APP_ENV=production` for the live plans. Each run prints two Plan IDs (Monthly and Yearly):

```
PAYPAL_SANDBOX_MONTHLY_PLAN_ID=...
PAYPAL_SANDBOX_YEARLY_PLAN_ID=...
PAYPAL_LIVE_MONTHLY_PLAN_ID=...
PAYPAL_LIVE_YEARLY_PLAN_ID=...
```

The script does **not** write to `.env` — copy the printed IDs into
`.env` manually.

### D. Webhooks

PayPal pings two separate endpoints, with **two separate webhook IDs**.
The setup steps are identical for each — just different URLs / events /
env keys.

#### D1. SaaS subscription webhook

1. Go to the PayPal app list for the environment you're configuring:
   - Sandbox: https://developer.paypal.com/dashboard/applications/sandbox
   - Live:    https://developer.paypal.com/dashboard/applications/live
2. Click on the app.
3. Scroll to the bottom and click the blue **Add Webhook** button.
4. Fill in:

- **Webhook URL:**
  - Sandbox app: `https://dev.argorobots.com/webhooks/paypal-subscription.php`
  - Live app:    `https://argorobots.com/webhooks/paypal-subscription.php`
- **Event types** — check these:
  - `BILLING.SUBSCRIPTION.ACTIVATED`
  - `BILLING.SUBSCRIPTION.CANCELLED`
  - `BILLING.SUBSCRIPTION.EXPIRED`
  - `BILLING.SUBSCRIPTION.SUSPENDED`
  - `BILLING.SUBSCRIPTION.PAYMENT.FAILED`
  - `PAYMENT.SALE.COMPLETED`
  - `PAYMENT.SALE.DENIED`
  - `PAYMENT.SALE.REFUNDED`

Click **Save**. After saving, copy the **Webhook ID** into the `.env`:

```
PAYPAL_SANDBOX_WEBHOOK_ID=...
PAYPAL_LIVE_WEBHOOK_ID=...
```

#### D2. Portal payment webhook

Same dashboard navigation as D1 — but you're adding a **second** webhook on each app (sandbox + live), pointing to a different URL and subscribing to different events.

- **Webhook URL:**
  - Sandbox app: `https://dev.argorobots.com/api/portal/webhooks/paypal`
  - Live app:    `https://argorobots.com/api/portal/webhooks/paypal`
- **Event types** — check these:
  - `PAYMENT.CAPTURE.COMPLETED`
  - `PAYMENT.CAPTURE.REFUNDED`

Click **Save**. After saving, copy the **Webhook ID** into the `.env`:

```
PAYPAL_PORTAL_SANDBOX_WEBHOOK_ID=...
PAYPAL_PORTAL_LIVE_WEBHOOK_ID=...
```

---

## Square

The portal Connect flow uses standard Square OAuth with the `PAYMENTS_WRITE`, `PAYMENTS_READ`, and `MERCHANT_PROFILE_READ` scopes. Subscription billing uses Square's Card-on-File API.

### A. Create the app

Unlike PayPal / Stripe sandbox-vs-live being separate apps, Square uses **one app with two environments**, toggled by the **Sandbox / Production** tabs at the top of each inner page.

1. Sign in at https://developer.squareup.com/console/en/apps.
2. Click the **+** tile to create a new app. Name it (e.g., "Argo Books"). If an app already exists, click **Open**.
3. In the left sidebar, go to **Credentials**. Switch between the **Sandbox** and **Production** tabs at the top of the page; for each tab copy:
   - **Application ID** (sandbox starts `sandbox-sq0idb-...`, production starts `sq0idp-...`)
   - **Access token** (click **Replace** if it's hidden / hasn't been generated yet)
4. In the left sidebar, click **Locations**. Pick a location for each environment and copy its **Location ID**.
   - **Sandbox location address:** anything — sandbox data is never seen by real customers.
   - **Live location address:** the registered address of Argo Books. For a sole proprietor with no separate office, your home address is fine. Note that this address appears on the receipts Square emails to customers, so use a P.O. Box / virtual office instead if you'd rather not put your home address on receipts — although, these are paid services (\$10 - \$30 / month)
5. Here's what the `.env` should look like:
   ```
   SQUARE_SANDBOX_APP_ID=sandbox-sq0idb-...
   SQUARE_SANDBOX_ACCESS_TOKEN=...
   SQUARE_SANDBOX_LOCATION_ID=...
   SQUARE_LIVE_APP_ID=sq0idp-...
   SQUARE_LIVE_ACCESS_TOKEN=...
   SQUARE_LIVE_LOCATION_ID=...
   ```
   The OAuth Application Secret (`SQUARE_*_APP_SECRET`) lives on the **OAuth** page, covered in section B.

### B. OAuth setup (portal Connect)

In the left sidebar of the app, click **OAuth**. Like the Credentials page, this page also has **Sandbox / Production** tabs at the top — repeat the steps below once per tab.

1. **Application Secret** — copy it into the `.env`:
   ```
   SQUARE_SANDBOX_APP_SECRET=...
   SQUARE_LIVE_APP_SECRET=...
   ```
2. **Redirect URL** — Square only allows one redirect URL per environment. Replace whatever's there with:
   - Sandbox tab: `https://dev.argorobots.com/api/portal/connect/callback/square`
   - Production tab: `https://argorobots.com/api/portal/connect/callback/square`

When an Argo Books user clicks **Connect** on Square, their browser is sent to Square's authorize URL (`connect.squareupsandbox.com/oauth2/authorize` in sandbox, `connect.squareup.com/oauth2/authorize` in live). If they land on a **blank page**, that means the Redirect URL saved on this OAuth page doesn't match what the server sent.

### C. Portal payment webhook

Square calls webhooks **Webhook subscriptions** — same idea, different name. In the left sidebar, click **Webhooks -> Subscriptions**. Repeat the steps below once per **Sandbox / Production** tab.

1. Click **Add subscription**.
2. **Name:** `Portal payments`.
3. **Notification URL:**
   - Sandbox tab: `https://dev.argorobots.com/api/portal/webhooks/square`
   - Production tab: `https://argorobots.com/api/portal/webhooks/square`
4. **API version:** `2025-10-16` — this should match the `Square-Version` header the rest of the code sends (grep `Square-Version` to verify the current value). If the code's API version is later bumped, update existing subscriptions to match so payload shapes stay consistent.
5. **Event types** — subscribe to:
   - `payment.created`
   - `payment.updated`
   - `refund.created`
   - `refund.updated`
6. After saving, click into the subscription and reveal the **Signature Key**. Copy to `.env`:
   ```
   SQUARE_SANDBOX_PORTAL_WEBHOOK_SIGNATURE_KEY=...
   SQUARE_LIVE_PORTAL_WEBHOOK_SIGNATURE_KEY=...
   ```
