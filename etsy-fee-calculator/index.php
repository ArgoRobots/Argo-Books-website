// etsy-fee-calculator/index.php
// Free Etsy fee calculator: works out every Etsy fee on a sale and what the
// seller actually keeps, and solves the same equation backwards to find the
// price that hits a target profit. Four countries, because payment processing
// and the regulatory operating fee are set by where the shop is based.
//
// Reuses the shared tool shell (shared/layout.php): header, "All tools"
// breadcrumb, canonical/OG, schema. Math is client-side (scripts/calc.js).
// Every rate comes from data/fees.php, which also feeds the on-page tables, so
// the numbers in the copy and the numbers in the calculator cannot drift apart.

The share is higher on cheaper items, around 14% on a $10 order, because the flat charges stay the same no matter the price.

      <h2>How much does Etsy take per sale?</h2>
      <p>On a straightforward US sale of around $30, Etsy takes about <strong>11%</strong> of the order: a <?= $pct($shared['transaction_pct'], 1) ?> transaction fee, payment processing of <?= $pct($countries['US']['processing_pct'], 0) ?> plus $<?= number_format($countries['US']['processing_flat'], 2) ?>, and the $<?= number_format($shared['listing_fee'], 2) ?> listing fee. On a $10 order the same fees come to <strong>14%</strong>, because the flat charges do not shrink with the price. Small orders always cost you a bigger share.</p>
      <p>If the order came through <strong>Offsite Ads</strong>, add another <?= $pct($shared['offsite_ads_over'], 0) ?> or <?= $pct($shared['offsite_ads_under'], 0) ?>, which takes the total past <strong>25%</strong>. Sellers in Canada and the UK pay a little more again because of the regulatory operating fee. The calculator above works out your exact figure rather than the average.</p>

      <h2>Every Etsy fee, explained</h2>

      <h2>How to use the calculator</h2>
      <h3>Mode one: what do I keep?</h3>
      <p>Enter what the item sells for and what you charge for shipping, then add your materials, your time, and what postage actually costs you. The right-hand panel splits the order into Etsy's cut, your costs, and your profit, line by line.</p>
      <h3>Mode two: what should I charge?</h3>
      <p>This is the one worth using. Instead of guessing a price and hoping, enter the profit you want from one sale and let it solve backwards. It returns the listing price that leaves you with exactly that amount once every fee and every cost is paid.</p>
      <h3>The yearly view</h3>
      <p>Add your rough sales per month and the per-sale numbers scale out to a year. Most sellers have never added their fees up across twelve months, and the total is usually larger than the guess.</p>

      <h2>A worked example</h2>
      <div class="calc-example">
        <p>You sell a candle for <strong>$28</strong> and charge <strong>$5</strong> shipping, so the order total is <strong>$33</strong>. Wax, wick, jar, and label come to <strong>$6</strong>. It takes you half an hour and you value your time at $16 an hour, so labour is <strong>$8</strong>. Postage and the mailer cost you <strong>$4.50</strong>. You are a US seller and this sale did not come through Offsite Ads.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Listing fee: <strong>$0.20</strong></li>
          <li>Transaction fee, <?= $pct($shared['transaction_pct'], 1) ?> of $33: <strong>$2.15</strong></li>
          <li>Payment processing, 3% of $33 plus $0.25: <strong>$1.24</strong></li>
          <li>Total Etsy fees: <strong>$3.59</strong>, or 10.9% of the order</li>
          <li>Your costs: <strong>$18.50</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Profit: $10.92 per candle, a 33% margin</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Now the part that changes decisions. At 15 sales a month, that is <strong>$645 a year to Etsy</strong> and <strong>$1,965 of profit</strong>. If that same order had come through Offsite Ads at 15%, the fee would jump by $4.95 and the profit would fall to <strong>$5.97</strong>, cutting what you earn almost in half.</p>

      <h2>Are Etsy fees tax deductible?</h2>
      <p>Yes. In the US, Canada, the UK, and Australia, fees a selling platform charges you are an ordinary business expense, deductible against your business income, as long as you are selling as a business rather than as a hobby.</p>
      <p>The catch is in the record keeping. Etsy deposits the <em>net</em> amount, so if you only ever record what hit your bank account, you have quietly understated both your revenue and your expenses by the amount of the fees. The totals are correct either way, but you lose the ability to see what the platform is costing you, and a tax return built from deposits alone will not match the income Etsy reports. Record the gross sale and the fee separately.</p>

      <h2>When one sale stops being the question</h2>
      <p>A calculator answers a single order. It cannot tell you which of your listings actually make money, what your supply runs cost last quarter, or whether the shop as a whole is ahead. Once you are selling every week, those are the questions that matter, and a spreadsheet rebuilt from scratch each January is a painful way to answer them.</p>
      <p>That is the gap <a class="calc-link" href="<?= INVGEN_BASE ?>/features/expense-revenue-tracking/<?= $ref_qs ?>&amp;placement=content">Argo Books</a> fills: it records your sales and expenses, keeps fees as their own category so you can see the real cost of selling, and shows your profit month by month instead of once a year. It runs on your own computer and it is free to start.</p>
