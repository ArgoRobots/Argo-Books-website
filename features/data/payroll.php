Payroll is Canada only, so it cannot pay staff in the United States or anywhere else.',
    ],
    [
        'q' => 'Is payroll included in the Free plan?',
        'a' => "No, payroll is a Premium feature. Premium is \${$argo_monthly} CAD a month, or \${$argo_yearly} a year, and includes everything else Premium covers rather than being priced per employee or per pay run. Most payroll services charge a monthly base fee plus a few dollars per person on top, so the comparison is worth doing with your own headcount.",
    ],
    [
        'q' => 'Where do the tax figures come from?',
        'a' => 'From the CRA\'s own payroll deduction formulas, and from Revenu Quebec for Quebec. None of the rates are written into the app: each edition is a data file that Argo Books checks and loads, and every figure is verified against the published tables before it ships.',

        'q' => 'The CRA changes the rates twice a year. What do I have to do?',
        'a' => 'Nothing. New rates take effect on 1 January and 1 July each year, and Argo Books fetches the new edition the first time you run a pay run that needs it. There is no update to install and no table to type in. If it cannot get the new edition, it tells you and declines to calculate rather than quietly using last period\'s figures.',

        'q' => 'Does Argo Books file my T4s or send money to the CRA?',
        'a' => 'No. It prepares the T4 slips and summary as PDFs and builds the XML file the CRA accepts, so the figures are worked out and the file is ready, but you upload it and you make the payment yourself. Argo Books also tells you what is owed and the date it is due, so the remittance is not a number you have to work out.',

What Argo Books does is gather the earnings and hours for the right number of pay periods, which is the part that otherwise means adding up 27 periods by hand on a five day deadline.',
