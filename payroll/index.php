                        Provider prices are published small-business rates for payroll only, taken at each vendor's
                        cheapest plan that allows unlimited pay runs, because Argo Books does not cap them either.
                        Wagepoint and QuickBooks both sell a tier around $20 cheaper that is limited to one pay run a
                        month, which is worth having if you pay monthly. QuickBooks Payroll also sits on top of a
                        QuickBooks Online subscription, so its real cost is higher than the figure shown, and Payworks
                        quotes per client rather than publishing a rate card. Check the current rate with any vendor
                        before you switch.

                        Payroll software is not judged on features. It is judged on whether a number was right eleven
                        months ago. These are the places that decision actually gets made.

                        <h3>Quebec is a second system, not a variation</h3>
                        <p>
                            Quebec runs its own income tax, pension plan and parental insurance. Argo Books calculates QPP,
                            QPIP, Quebec income tax and the federal abatement separately, and works the RL-1 figures out for you. Staff in
                            different provinces can sit on the same pay run.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Rates change twice a year, on their own</h3>
                        <p>
                            The CRA reissues its tables every January and July. Each edition is a data file fetched the
                            first time a pay period needs it, so there is nothing to install and no chance of running
                            January on last year's figures.
                        </p>

                        <h3>It stops rather than guesses</h3>
                        <p>
                            If it does not hold the table covering a pay date, it says so and declines to calculate. A
                            wrong deduction on someone's pay is the kind of error nothing downstream catches, so refusing
                            is the safer failure.

                        <h3>Remittances come with their date</h3>
                        <p>
                            A regular remitter pays by the 15th of the month after payday. Argo Books names that date and
                            the amount belonging to it, rather than leaving you to work out which month you are paying for.

                        <h3>Staff records stay on your computer</h3>
                        <p>
                            Payroll holds the most sensitive data in the business: names, social insurance numbers and what
                            everyone earns. Argo Books is a desktop app, so those records are written to your machine
                            rather than uploaded to a provider.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Wages are already in your books</h3>
                        <p>
                            Approving a run records what each person was actually paid as an expense, so payday matches
                            your bank statement instead of being a figure you copy across from a separate payroll service.

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>You pay staff outside Canada.</strong> Payroll is Canada only. It cannot run a US or overseas payroll, and it is not going to.</li>
                        <li><strong>You want the filing and the remittance done for you.</strong> Argo Books prepares the slips and the XML and tells you what is owed and when. You upload it and you pay it. A full-service provider does both, and that is worth money to some businesses.</li>
                        <li><strong>You need direct deposit run from the payroll tool.</strong> Argo Books works out the pay and records it. Moving the money is still your bank.</li>
                        <li><strong>You file RL-1 slips in Quebec.</strong> The deductions are worked out and the RL-1 figures are put on a worksheet, but Revenu Qu&eacute;bec accepts a printed slip only from software it has certified, and requires XML above five slips. Neither exists here, so the Quebec slips are keyed into My Account by hand.</li>
                        <li><strong>You are on macOS.</strong> Windows and Linux today. A Mac build is not out yet.</li>
                    </ul>

                        If any of those matter more to you than the per-employee bill, one of the providers in the table
                        above is genuinely the better answer, and it is cheaper to find that out now.
