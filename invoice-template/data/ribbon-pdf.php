It reads as formal in the way a law firm letterhead does, which makes it a good fit for legal practices, accountants, and consultants who bill on long-form engagements. Click "Customize and download PDF" to open the generator with Ribbon preselected.</p>',

    '<p>The Ribbon PDF template suits established businesses that want their invoice to look familiar to every recipient. The thin navy rule anchors the header, the "INVOICE" label is unambiguous at first glance, and the table of line items reads cleanly even when printed on plain paper.</p>'
    . '<p>You can edit every label on the invoice surface. If your business uses "Description" rather than "Service", change the column header. If you charge a flat fee rather than billing by quantity and rate, you can rename those columns too. The PDF download captures whatever you see on screen.</p>',
