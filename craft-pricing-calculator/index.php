      <h2>How to price your handmade products (quick answer)</h2>
      <p>Add your <strong>material cost</strong> and <strong>labour cost</strong> together to get what one item really costs you to make. Then apply a <strong>markup</strong> to set your selling price. The standard handmade formula is:</p>
      <p class="craft-formula">Selling price = (material cost + labour cost) &times; (1 + markup %)</p>
      <p>Most handmade sellers use a markup of <strong>100% to 200%</strong>, which leaves a profit margin of about <strong>50% to 67%</strong>. The calculator above does the maths for you and shows your profit and margin as you type.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>How to use the calculator</h2>
      <h3>The three inputs</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Material cost</strong>: everything you use to make one item, including packaging and labels. Use the cost <em>per item</em>, not the price of the whole pack.</li>
        <li><strong>Labour cost</strong>: your time. Pick an hourly rate you would be happy to earn, then multiply by how long one item takes to make.</li>
        <li><strong>Markup</strong>: the percentage you add on top of your cost. Tap a preset for your sales channel, or type your own.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Reading the results</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Suggested selling price</strong>: what to charge per item at that markup.</li>
        <li><strong>Materials &amp; labour</strong>: your total cost to make one item.</li>
        <li><strong>Your profit</strong>: what you keep per item after costs.</li>
        <li><strong>Profit margin</strong>: your profit as a share of the selling price.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Markup and margin by sales channel</h2>
      <p>Where you sell changes how much to mark up. Selling direct lets you keep more; selling wholesale means leaving room for the shop to mark the item up again.</p>
      <table class="craft-table">
        <thead>
          <tr><th scope="col">Where you sell</th><th scope="col">Typical markup</th><th scope="col">Profit margin</th></tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
          <?php foreach ($channels as $c): ?>
            <tr>
              <td><?= htmlspecialchars($c['name']) ?></td>
              <td><?= htmlspecialchars($c['markup']) ?></td>
              <td><?= htmlspecialchars($c['margin']) ?></td>
            </tr>
          <?php endforeach; ?>
        </tbody>
      </table>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>The formula explained</h2>
      <p>Two quick calculations sit behind the result:</p>
      <p class="craft-formula">Selling price = (material cost + labour cost) &times; (1 + markup %)</p>
      <p class="craft-formula">Profit margin = (selling price &minus; total cost) &divide; selling price</p>
      <p>Markup and margin are not the same number. A 100% markup (doubling your cost) is a 50% margin. That difference trips up a lot of sellers, so the calculator shows both.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>A worked example</h2>
      <div class="craft-example">
        <p>Say you make soap in batches. A batch of <strong>20 bars</strong> uses <strong>$40</strong> of oils, lye, fragrance, and packaging, so materials are $40 &divide; 20 = <strong>$2.00 per bar</strong>. The batch takes about an hour and you value your time at $20/hour, so labour is $20 &divide; 20 = <strong>$1.00 per bar</strong>. Dividing the batch cost across every bar gives your true per-item cost. You sell on Etsy, so you pick a <strong>150% markup</strong>.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Total cost: $2.00 + $1.00 = <strong>$3.00 per bar</strong></li>
          <li>Selling price: $3.00 &times; 2.5 = <strong>$7.50</strong></li>
          <li>Your profit: <strong>$4.50</strong> per bar</li>
          <li>Profit margin: <strong>60%</strong></li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Common pricing mistakes</h2>
      <ol class="craft-mistakes">
        <li><strong>Not paying yourself for labour.</strong> Your time is a real cost. Leave it out and your "profit" is really just unpaid wages.</li>
        <li><strong>Using the pack price instead of the per-item cost.</strong> Divide the cost of a pack by how many items it makes.</li>
        <li><strong>Copying a competitor's price.</strong> You do not know their costs. Price from your own numbers, then sanity-check against the market.</li>
        <li><strong>Forgetting overhead.</strong> Stall fees, online listing fees, and equipment add up. Build a little extra into your markup to cover them.</li>
      </ol>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Who is this calculator for?</h2>
      <p>Anyone selling something they make by hand: soap and candle makers, jewellers, bakers, potters, woodworkers, and crafters selling on Etsy, at markets, or wholesale to shops. If you make it and sell it, this gets you to a price that pays you fairly.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>When to move beyond a calculator</h2>
      <p>A calculator prices one product at a time. Once you are selling regularly, the bigger question is whether the whole business is profitable across every sale, every supply run, and every fee. That is where <a class="craft-link" href="<?= INVGEN_BASE ?>/features/expense-revenue-tracking/<?= $ref_qs ?>&amp;placement=content">Argo Books</a> comes in: it tracks your income and expenses, shows your real profit month to month, and helps you send invoices and stay ready for tax time. It is free to start.</p>
