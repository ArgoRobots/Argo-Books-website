            <p>Create professional invoices in seconds, track payment status, and get paid faster with
            integrated payment processing. Argo Books makes invoicing simple and efficient.</p>

            <div class="info-box">
                <p><strong>Note:</strong> The free version includes up to <?= (int) $pricing['free_invoice_monthly_limit'] ?> invoices per month. <a href="../getting-started/version-comparison.php" class="link">Upgrade to Premium</a> for unlimited invoices and online payment integration.</p>

            <h2>Setting Up Payment Integration</h2>
            <p>This is a one-time setup and should be your first step: it's what enables customers to pay your invoices online. Argo Books connects to <strong>Stripe</strong> and <strong>Square</strong>, covering credit and debit cards, Apple Pay, Google Pay, and more.</p>
            <ol class="steps-list">
                <li>Go to <strong>Settings &gt; Payment Portal</strong></li>
                <li>Set your company name and portal logo. These appear on the payment portal your customers see when paying an invoice</li>
                <li>Set your owner email and confirm it with the emailed code. It is used for refund verification and account recovery, and a provider cannot be connected until it is set</li>
                <li>Under "Connected Payment Providers", click <strong>Connect</strong> on Stripe or Square to link your existing account, or create one during the connect step</li>
                <li>Authorize Argo Books to process payments on your behalf</li>
            </ol>

            <div class="info-box">
                <p><strong>Note:</strong> A standard <strong>Stripe</strong> or <strong>Square seller</strong> account is all you need. Argo Books connects to your account, it never stores your payment credentials.</p>
            </div>

            <h2>Creating Invoices</h2>
            <p>Now that your payment integration is set up, you can now generate professional invoices with just a few clicks:</p>
            <ol class="steps-list">
                <li>Go to "Invoices" in the navigation menu, under Revenue</li>
                <li>Click "Create Invoice"</li>
                <li>Select a customer or create a new one</li>
                <li>Add line items from your product catalog</li>
                <li>Set payment terms and due date</li>
                <li>Preview and send</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>Payment Portal</h2>
            <p>When you connect a payment provider, customers can pay invoices online:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Customers receive an email with their invoice and a link to your payment portal</li>
                <li>They can pay securely using their preferred payment method</li>
                <li>Payments sync automatically with your Argo Books company</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Payment Tracking</h2>
            <p>Keep track of all your invoices and their payment status:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Draft:</strong> Invoice being prepared, never sent</li>
                <li><strong>Pending:</strong> Invoice is ready but has not been sent yet</li>
                <li><strong>Sent:</strong> Invoice delivered to customer, awaiting payment</li>
                <li><strong>Viewed:</strong> The customer opened it on the payment portal</li>
                <li><strong>Partial:</strong> Customer has made a partial payment</li>
                <li><strong>Paid:</strong> Invoice fully paid</li>
                <li><strong>Overdue:</strong> Payment is past the due date and not fully paid</li>
                <li><strong>Cancelled:</strong> Invoice has been cancelled</li>
                <li><strong>Refunded:</strong> Invoice was paid, then fully refunded</li>
                <li><strong>Partially Refunded:</strong> Invoice was paid, then refunded in part</li>
            </ul>
            <p>See <a class="link" href="../reference/how-numbers-are-calculated.php#invoice-status">How Numbers Are Calculated</a> for how each status affects your revenue and profit figures.</p>

            <div class="info-box">
                <p><strong>Note:</strong> When you record a payment manually, link it to an invoice or to a revenue so it stays tied to your income. Payments made through the online portal are linked to their invoice automatically.</p>
            </div>

            <h2>Payment processing fees</h2>
            <p>Payment processing fees are charged by the payment provider, not Argo Books. Both Stripe and Square typically charge around 2.9% + $0.30 per transaction. Because the exact rate depends on many different factors, Argo Books adds the 2.9% + $0.30 for every transaction.</p>
            <p>You decide if you want to pass this fee onto your customer, or take the cost yourself. There is a "pass processing fee" toggle:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Toggle on</strong> → passes the cost on to the customer. Customer pays invoice total + 2.9% + $0.30.</li>
                <li><strong>Toggle off</strong> → customer pays just the invoice total. You absorb the fee.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>When your customers pay the invoices, the total amount and the fee go into your account. It's when you take the money out of your Stripe or Square account and move it into your normal bank account that they charge you. The fee may be slightly different than the 2.9% + $0.30, especially if your customer is in a different country.</p>
            <p>Argo Books does not add any extra fee on top of the payment providers.</p>
            
            <div class="info-box">
                <p><strong>Tip:</strong> This is a per-invoice choice, not a global setting. The <strong>"Pass processing fee to customer"</strong> checkbox is on the Create Invoice modal and is ticked by default. Untick it on any invoice where you would rather absorb the fee yourself.</p>
            </div>

            <h2>Payment Security</h2>
            <p>Your payment data is protected:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>All payment processing happens on the payment provider's secure servers</li>
                <li>Argo Books never stores card numbers or bank details</li>
                <li>PCI DSS compliant through certified providers</li>
                <li>End-to-end encryption for all transactions</li>
            </ul>
