A batch using 2oz of a $4-an-ounce fragrance carries $8 of scent across maybe ten bars, so 80 cents a bar from one ingredient.

Most countries require an ingredient list, weight, and your business details, and rules differ sharply depending on whether the product is sold as soap or makes a cosmetic claim like moisturising or anti-acne.

      <h2>What this tool does, and what it does not</h2>
      <p>This calculator prices your soap. It works out what a batch costs, divides it into a true cost per bar, and shows you what to charge to make a living from it.</p>
      <p>It is <strong>not a lye calculator</strong>. It will not tell you how much sodium hydroxide your oils need, and you should not use it for that. Saponification maths is safety-critical, the established soap calculators do it well, and a mistake there causes chemical burns rather than a bad margin. Work your recipe out there, then bring the costs here.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Cost the batch, not the shopping</h2>
      <p class="calc-formula">Cost per bar = batch materials &divide; sellable bars + your time + selling costs</p>
      <p>Two details separate an accurate number from a comfortable guess:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Use what the batch consumed.</strong> A $22 gallon of olive oil is roughly $0.17 an ounce, so a batch using 30oz costs $5.10, not $22.</li>
        <li><strong>Count sellable bars, not theoretical ones.</strong> A loaf that cuts into 12 usually gives 10 you would actually put on a table once the end pieces are trimmed. Using the theoretical number understates your cost per bar by about 17%, which is roughly the whole margin difference between a good month and a bad one.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>A worked example</h2>
      <div class="calc-example">
        <p>A cold process batch cutting into <strong>10</strong> sellable bars:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Oils and butters: <strong>$9.40</strong>. Lye and distilled water: <strong>$1.60</strong>. Fragrance: <strong>$8.00</strong>. Mica and oats: <strong>$2.10</strong>. Wraps and labels: <strong>$3.50</strong>.</li>
          <li>Batch materials: <strong>$24.60</strong>, so <strong>$2.46</strong> a bar.</li>
          <li>Roughly 80 minutes across the whole batch, so 8 minutes a bar. At $20 an hour that is <strong>$2.67</strong>.</li>
          <li>Market stall share and card fees: <strong>$0.60</strong> a bar.</li>
          <li><strong>True cost per bar: $5.73.</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p>At the $6 a bar that feels normal at a market, you are making <strong>27 cents</strong>. At a 150% markup the bar is <strong>$14.33</strong>, which is high for a market table, and that tension is the real finding: this batch is too small and too slow. Doubling the batch size spreads the same 80 minutes across 20 bars and drops the true cost to around <strong>$4.40</strong>, which makes $9 a bar a genuinely good business.</p>
      </div>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Batch size is the lever that matters</h2>
      <p>Soap is unusual among crafts: the material cost per bar is genuinely low, but the setup is nearly identical whether you are making ten bars or forty. Measuring, heating, mixing, cleaning, and the safety routine take about the same time either way.</p>
      <p>That means volume moves your cost per bar more than any ingredient substitution will. Before you switch to a cheaper oil to save eight cents, try making twice as much at once and watch the labour per bar halve.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>The cost soap makers most often miss</h2>
      <ol class="calc-list">
        <li><strong>Fragrance, costed by the bottle instead of by the batch.</strong> It is the most expensive thing per ounce in most recipes and usage is a percentage of oil weight, so it scales with batch size in a way the mica does not.</li>
        <li><strong>Trimmed ends and failed batches.</strong> Seizing, ricing, partial gel, a scent that faded in cure. Build slack into the markup.</li>
        <li><strong>Cure time as cash flow.</strong> Six weeks between spending the money and being able to sell the bar is a real business cost even though it never appears on a receipt.</li>
        <li><strong>Safety gear and equipment.</strong> Goggles, gloves, dedicated pots and moulds. Spread across batches, small; ignored entirely, invisible.</li>
        <li><strong>Labelling compliance.</strong> Ingredient lists and required details mean label reprints when a recipe changes.</li>
      </ol>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Selling soap wholesale</h2>
      <p>Wholesale looks brutal at a 75% markup until you see what it does to your time. Selling 60 bars in one invoice to a shop takes a fraction of the hours of selling 60 bars individually at a market, and there is no stall fee, no travel, and no standing in the rain.</p>
      <p>Run both through the calculator. The wholesale margin per bar is lower and the profit per hour is frequently higher, which is why most soap businesses that grow end up doing both.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>When one batch stops being the question</h2>
      <p>A calculator prices one batch. It cannot tell you which scents actually sell, what you spent on oils across the year, or whether the market stall pays for itself once travel is counted. Those are the questions that decide whether soap making becomes a business.</p>
