        <div class="docs-content">
            <p>Once your pay runs are recorded, Argo Books produces the forms you have to give employees and
            file with the government: T4 slips, the T4 summary, Quebec RL-1 slips, and a Record of
            Employment worksheet.</p>

            <div class="info-box">
                <p><strong>Note:</strong> Argo Books does not file on your behalf. It generates the slips and the upload file; you submit them through CRA or Revenu Québec yourself.</p>
            </div>

            <h2>Remittance Due</h2>
            <p>The payroll dashboard shows what has to reach CRA next and by when. This is deliberately
            <strong>last month's withholdings against this month's due date</strong>, not the current
            month's running total. A regular remitter pays by the 15th of the month following the month the
            deductions were withheld, so the figure you need is the one that has already closed.</p>

            <h2>T4 Slips and Summary</h2>
            <p>At year end, Argo Books produces both the slips your employees need and the file CRA needs:</p>
            <ol class="steps-list">
                <li>Go to "Pay Runs" and open the year-end tool</li>
                <li>Select the tax year</li>
                <li>Enter your filing details, including your CRA payroll account number</li>
                <li>Clear anything listed under "Fix these before filing"</li>
                <li>Click "Download slips" for the PDFs to distribute, and "Export for filing" for the XML to upload</li>
            </ol>
            <p>The XML is wrapped in the T619 transmittal that CRA's electronic filing expects, so it can be
            uploaded as-is.</p>

            <div class="info-box">
                <p><strong>Deadline:</strong> T4s are due to CRA and to your employees by the last day of February.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="info-box">
                <p><strong>Note:</strong> The payroll account number is the one ending in <strong>RP</strong>, not RC. It is on your CRA statement of account. Quebec employers also need their Revenu Québec identification number, which is a different number found on your Revenu Québec statement.</p>
            </div>

            <h2>Amendments and Cancellations</h2>
            <p>If something was wrong on a slip you have already filed, regenerate it as an amendment rather
            than a new original. Argo Books supports all three types:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Original:</strong> The first filing for that employee and year</li>
                <li><strong>Amended:</strong> A correction to a slip already filed</li>
                <li><strong>Cancelled:</strong> A slip that should not have been filed at all</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Slips are selected per employee, so you can amend one person without regenerating the whole
            year. Tick only the employees whose slips changed.</p>

            <div class="info-box">
                <p><strong>Important:</strong> Send an amended return on its own. CRA rejects a return that mixes amended and original slips.</p>
            </div>

            <h2>Quebec RL-1</h2>
            <p>Employers in Quebec file with Revenu Québec as well as CRA. Argo Books produces RL-1 slips
            and the RL-1 summary as PDFs alongside the federal T4 package, covering QPP, QPIP and Quebec
            tax. They do not include the health services fund.</p>

            <h2>Record of Employment</h2>
            <p>An ROE is due within five days of an interruption of earnings, not at year end, so it is
            offered from the employee's row rather than from the year-end tool. Argo Books produces a
            worksheet containing the figures ROE Web asks for, which you then key in.</p>

            <div class="info-box">
                <p><strong>Note:</strong> The worksheet leaves block 16, the reason for issuing, blank. Argo Books has no way to know why someone stopped being paid, and that field affects an employee's benefit eligibility, so it is left for you to complete.</p>
            </div>

            <h2>Before You File</h2>
            <p>The year-end tool lists anything that would stop a filing under "Fix these before filing",
            so work through that first. It also shows your total employment income and tax for the year,
            which is worth comparing against what you actually remitted to CRA over the twelve months.</p>
            <p>Two details that are easy to miss:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Dental coverage codes</strong> are required on every T4, so an employee missing one will hold up the filing</li>
                <li><strong>Social insurance numbers</strong> are not strictly required for a T4, and one will file without them, but the contributions are then not credited to that employee. An RL-1 or a Record of Employment does require one</li>
            </ul>
