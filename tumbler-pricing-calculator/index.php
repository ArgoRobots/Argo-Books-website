      <h2>What should you charge for a tumbler?</h2>
      <p>The number people quote each other in Facebook groups is usually "blank cost times three". That is a fine starting point and a terrible finishing point, because it silently assumes your time is free and your shipping is free.</p>
      <p class="calc-formula">Price = (blank + supplies + packaging + your time + selling costs) &times; (1 + markup)</p>
      <p>Once the time is in, most makers selling direct land on a markup of <strong>150% to 200%</strong>. The tumbler that felt like it should be $25 usually needs to be $35 or more, and that gap is almost entirely the hour you spent weeding and pressing it.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Time is the whole game on tumblers</h2>
      <p>Unlike candles or soap, where materials dominate, a decorated tumbler is mostly labour. A single custom design can take 45 minutes of genuine hands-on work between designing, weeding, taping, pressing, and cleanup, on a blank that cost $6.</p>
      <p>Two rules make this manageable:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Only count hands-on time.</strong> An epoxy tumbler might spin on the turner for twelve hours, but you are not standing there. Count the mixing, pouring, sanding, and finishing. Count press time only if you are tied to the machine.</li>
        <li><strong>Separate design time from production time.</strong> Making the same design twenty times is a completely different cost to making twenty different ones. If you sell a design repeatedly, its setup time gets spread; if every order is bespoke, it does not.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>A worked example</h2>
      <div class="calc-example">
        <p>One custom 20oz sublimation tumbler:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Blank: <strong>$6.50</strong>. Sublimation paper and ink: <strong>$1.80</strong>. Heat tape and butcher paper: <strong>$0.60</strong>. Box and bubble wrap: <strong>$2.10</strong>.</li>
          <li>Materials: <strong>$11.00</strong>.</li>
          <li>45 minutes of real work at $22 an hour: <strong>$16.50</strong>.</li>
          <li>Etsy fees and postage: <strong>$8.40</strong>.</li>
          <li><strong>True cost: $35.90.</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p>At the $30 a lot of makers charge, that order <strong>loses money</strong> once your time is counted, even though it feels like a $19 profit against the blank. At a 150% markup the price is <strong>$89.75</strong>, which is more than the market will bear for a plain design, and that is genuinely useful information: it tells you this design needs to be sold more than once, or made faster, or sold at a market where you are not paying shipping.</p>
      </div>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>What to do when the honest price is too high</h2>
      <p>This calculator will sometimes hand you a number nobody will pay. That is not a reason to ignore it. It is the tool telling you the current setup does not work, and there are only four real levers:</p>
      <ol class="calc-list">
        <li><strong>Sell the design more than once.</strong> Spread the design time across ten sales instead of one and the per-tumbler cost collapses. This is why the makers who do well have a catalogue, not an endless queue of one-offs.</li>
        <li><strong>Get faster.</strong> Batch the weeding, cut several designs at once, press back to back while the machine is hot.</li>
        <li><strong>Cut a cost that is not the product.</strong> Cheaper mailers and a better postage rate move the number more than switching to worse vinyl.</li>
        <li><strong>Charge a design fee.</strong> Separate the artwork from the tumbler so custom buyers pay for custom work, and repeat buyers do not.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>What is not on that list is cutting your hourly rate to make the maths work. That is not a price change, it is a pay cut.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Bulk and team orders</h2>
      <p>Twenty tumblers for a cheer squad is not twenty individual jobs. Enter the whole run as one batch: the blanks and vinyl for all twenty, the real quantity in the batch field, and a much lower per-tumbler time, because the design is done once and pressing gets quicker after the first three.</p>
      <p>A 90% markup on a bulk run frequently pays you better per hour than a 200% markup on a one-off, which surprises people. Volume works when setup time is shared.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>When one order stops being the question</h2>
      <p>A calculator prices one tumbler. It cannot tell you whether last month was profitable, which designs actually sell, or how much you spent on blanks over the year. Once orders are steady, those questions matter more than any single price.</p>
      <p><a class="calc-link" href="<?= INVGEN_BASE ?>/features/expense-revenue-tracking/<?= $ref_qs ?>&amp;placement=content">Argo Books</a> records your supply orders and sales, keeps fees as their own category, and shows your real profit month by month.
