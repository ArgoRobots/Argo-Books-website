It suits brands that already have strong visual identity elsewhere and want the invoice to stay out of the way. Click "Customize and download PDF" to open the generator with Formal preselected.</p>',

  'body_html' =>
    '<p>The Formal PDF template suits established businesses that want their invoice to look familiar to every recipient. The whitespace lets the content breathe, the "INVOICE" label is unambiguous at first glance, and the table of line items reads cleanly even when printed on plain paper.</p>'
    . '<p>You can edit every label on the invoice surface. If your business uses "Description" rather than "Service", change the column header. If you charge a flat fee rather than billing by quantity and rate, you can rename those columns too. The PDF download captures whatever you see on screen.</p>',
