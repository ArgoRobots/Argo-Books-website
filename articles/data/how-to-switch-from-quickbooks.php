<p>Switching accounting software feels riskier than it is. Your books hold years of invoices, expenses, and reports, and the thought of moving all of that somewhere new is enough to keep plenty of people paying for a subscription they've outgrown, or outgrown paying for. The quiet truth is that most switches are far smaller jobs than they look, because you don't need to move most of that history. You need a clean starting point, a handful of open items, and a permanent copy of the past you can open any time.</p>
<p>This guide walks through the whole process in seven steps: deciding what actually needs to come with you, exporting from QuickBooks (Online or Desktop), saving the reports that become your archive, picking a start date, importing into the new tool, running a short overlap to check the numbers, and finally cancelling. No horror stories, no pressure. Just the calm, boring way to move your books without losing anything that matters.</p>

      'html' => <<<'HTML'
<p>This is the step that shrinks the whole project. People imagine they have to move every transaction since the day they opened, and that idea alone is what makes switching feel impossible. In practice, the list of things that genuinely need to live inside your new software is short:</p>
{{illustration:checklist}}
<ul>
<li><strong>Open invoices.</strong> Anything a customer still owes you. These need to exist in the new tool so you can chase them and record the payments when they arrive.</li>
<li><strong>Your customer and vendor lists.</strong> Names, emails, addresses. You'll invoice these people again next month, so bring them along.</li>
<li><strong>This year's transactions.</strong> Income and expenses from your chosen start date onward, so the current year's books are complete in one place for tax time.</li>
<li><strong>Closing balances.</strong> The bank balance and any amounts owed to you or by you as of your switch date, so the new books start from reality instead of zero.</li>
<li><strong>Items or products,</strong> if you sell from a list of set products or services.</li>
</ul>
<p>Everything else, five years of paid invoices, old expense detail, ancient reports, does not need to be re-entered anywhere. It needs to be saved, which is a different and much easier job, and it's exactly what steps 2 and 3 handle. Old history belongs in an archive you keep, not in the working books you use every day.</p>

      'html' => <<<'HTML'
<p>QuickBooks lets you export your lists and reports to Excel or CSV files, and those files are the raw material for everything that follows. Both QuickBooks Online and QuickBooks Desktop can do this, though the menus differ between the two and Intuit rearranges them from time to time, so rather than memorizing exact clicks, look for the export options under the reports and lists screens. Most list pages and most reports have an export button somewhere near the top, often behind a small spreadsheet or download icon.</p>
<p>Work through your lists first: customers, vendors, and your products and services. Export each one to Excel or CSV. Then export transaction detail for the current year, a transaction list or general ledger style report covering your chosen date range usually does the job. If you run payroll or track inventory in QuickBooks, export those reports too, even if you're not sure you'll need them.</p>
<p>Save everything into one folder with a clear name, something like "QuickBooks export 2026", and don't tidy or edit the files yet. The goal at this stage is simply to get complete copies out while you still have full access to your account. Messy but complete beats neat but missing, and you can clean up columns later when you import.</p>

      'step_text' => 'Save profit and loss, balance sheet, open invoice, and aged receivables reports as PDF and spreadsheet files for every year you have. This archive means you keep your history even after the subscription ends.',
      'html' => <<<'HTML'
<p>Here's the honest answer to the biggest fear about switching: no, you don't lose your history, but only if you save it before you cancel. Once a QuickBooks subscription ends, your access to the data eventually goes with it, and at the time of writing, read-only grace periods exist but have limits. So treat this step as non-negotiable. Before you cancel anything, download a set of reports that captures the story of your business:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Profit and loss</strong>, for each year you've been on QuickBooks, plus the current year to date.</li>
<li><strong>Balance sheet</strong>, as of each year-end and as of your switch date.</li>
<li><strong>Open invoices</strong>, so you have an independent record of who owed you what on the day you moved.</li>
<li><strong>Aged receivables</strong> (and aged payables if you owe suppliers), for the same reason.</li>
<li><strong>Sales tax reports</strong>, if you collect sales tax, GST, or VAT, since tax authorities can ask about past periods years later.</li>
</ul>
<p>Save each one as a PDF, and where QuickBooks offers it, as a spreadsheet too. The PDF is the human-readable record; the spreadsheet is the version you can dig into later. Put them in the same folder as your step 2 exports, back that folder up somewhere safe, ideally two places, and you now hold your history outright. No subscription required to read your own past, ever again. That folder is what makes the rest of the switch low-stakes.</p>

      'step_text' => 'Choose the first day of a month, quarter, or year as the dividing line. Everything before it lives in your archive; everything from that day onward lives in the new tool.',
      'html' => <<<'HTML'
<p>Your start date is the dividing line: everything before it lives in your archive, everything on or after it lives in your new software. Picking a clean line keeps the books simple, and the cleanest lines are the natural ones. The start of a month is good. The start of a quarter is better. The start of your financial year is best of all, because then an entire tax year sits in one system and your accountant never has to stitch two tools together for a single return.</p>
<p>That said, don't wait half a year just to get a perfect date. If it's August and you're done with QuickBooks, the first of next month is a perfectly good line. You'd enter this year's transactions from January through your start date into the new tool (or import them, see the next step) so the full year ends up in one place, and let the archive cover everything earlier.</p>
<p>Whatever date you pick, write down your closing balances as of the day before: bank accounts, total owed by customers, total owed to suppliers. Those numbers are the handshake between the old books and the new ones, and you'll use them again in step 6 to prove the switch worked.</p>

      'step_text' => 'Bring your exported CSV and spreadsheet files into the new software, starting with customer and vendor lists, then this year\'s transactions, then re-create any open invoices.',
      'html' => <<<'HTML'
<p>Now the files you exported come back to life. Most modern accounting tools accept CSV or spreadsheet imports for lists and transactions, and this is where the switch actually happens. Bring things in roughly in this order: customer and vendor lists first, then your products or services, then the current year's transactions, and finally re-create any open invoices so they're ready to be paid in the new system.</p>
{{illustration:spreadsheet-to-books}}
<p>Be realistic about what "import" means. This is an import, not an automatic migration: no tool waves a wand over a QuickBooks account and rebuilds it perfectly somewhere else, and any service claiming otherwise still involves cleanup. Your exported files will have QuickBooks' column names and formatting quirks, so expect to spend a little time mapping columns and checking that dates and amounts landed correctly.</p>
<p>This is where Argo Books is genuinely convenient: its AI spreadsheet and CSV import reads exported files like the ones QuickBooks produces and works out what each column means, so you spend minutes mapping instead of an afternoon rearranging spreadsheets. It can read bank statements the same way. It's still an import, you'll still glance over the results, but it takes most of the tedium out of this step. If your data lives partly in spreadsheets already, our guide on <a href="/how-to-convert-excel-spreadsheet-to-accounting-software/">converting a spreadsheet into accounting software</a> covers that side in detail.</p>

      'step_text' => 'Keep both tools available for a few weeks. Compare bank balances, amounts owed by customers, and the current year\'s profit between old and new, and fix any differences before relying on the new books.',
      'html' => <<<'HTML'
<p>Don't cancel QuickBooks the same day you import. Give yourself a short overlap, a few weeks or one full month is usually plenty, where the old account still exists and the new tool is doing the real work. During that window, check three numbers between the two systems:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Bank balance.</strong> The balance in your new books as of the switch date should match your closing balance from step 4, and both should match up with what your actual bank statement says.</li>
<li><strong>Amounts owed by customers.</strong> The open invoices you re-created should add up to the same total as the open invoice report you archived. If a customer pays an old invoice during the overlap, record it in the new tool.</li>
<li><strong>Year-to-date profit.</strong> If you brought in the current year's transactions, run a profit and loss in the new tool and compare it to the one you saved from QuickBooks. Small differences usually trace back to a duplicated or missed transaction, and they're much easier to find now than at tax time.</li>
</ol>
<p>Once those three agree, you have real evidence the switch worked, not just a feeling. Do all new invoicing and expense entry in the new tool during the overlap; the old account is a reference, not a workspace. Entering things in both places doubles the work and invites the two systems to drift apart.</p>

      'step_text' => 'Once the numbers agree, cancel the subscription, confirm the cancellation in writing, and store your archive folder in two safe places for future tax questions.',
      'html' => <<<'HTML'
<p>When the numbers agree and you've stopped opening QuickBooks for anything but reference, it's time to finish the job. Before you press cancel, do one last sweep: confirm your archive folder actually contains the reports from step 3, open a couple of the files to make sure they're readable, and check you've exported anything you added since, like invoices created during the overlap. Then cancel the subscription and keep the confirmation email.</p>
<p>Your archive folder is now a permanent part of your business records. Store it in at least two places, for example your computer plus a cloud drive or an external drive, and treat it with the same care as your tax filings. Tax authorities in most countries can ask about past years long after the fact, often six or seven years back, so those PDFs may earn their keep one day. The exact retention rules vary by country, so check with your local tax authority or accountant.</p>
<p>And that's the whole switch. If you're still weighing up where to land, our guide to the <a href="/best-quickbooks-alternatives/">best QuickBooks alternatives</a> compares the realistic options, including where Argo Books fits and where it doesn't. None of this is a criticism of QuickBooks; it's a capable tool. But plenty of people are simply done paying for more than they use, and moving on is a smaller, calmer job than it looks from the outside.</p>

You almost never need a five-year-old paid invoice inside your day-to-day books; if a question ever comes up, you open the archive and look it up there.
