<p>Photography is a business where the money moves in a way that trips up ordinary accounting tools. A wedding books ten months out with a deposit, the balance lands the week of the shoot, and half your year's income arrives in a summer rush. On top of that you're buying expensive gear, driving to venues, and juggling personal and business spending on the same card. The right software makes all of that simple. The wrong one turns tax season into a scramble.</p>
<p>This guide walks through what photographers actually need from accounting software, then shows you how to judge the options honestly. If you want the underlying bookkeeping habits first, start with our companion guide on <a href="/bookkeeping-for-photographers/">bookkeeping for photographers</a>. Here we're focused on the software choice itself: the features that matter, where a cheap simple tool is plenty, and the cases where you'd genuinely be better off with something else.</p>

      'anchor' => 'what-photographers-need',
      'html' => <<<'HTML'
<p>Before you compare products, get clear on what your particular business demands. A wedding photographer, a portrait studio, an event shooter, and a freelancer who does a bit of everything all share the same handful of needs. Judge any tool against these, not against a long feature list you'll never touch.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Professional invoicing with deposits and retainers.</strong> Most bookings start with a deposit and finish with a balance. Your software has to send a clean invoice, record the deposit, and track what's still owed without you doing mental math.</li>
<li><strong>Gear and expense tracking.</strong> Cameras, lenses, lighting, editing subscriptions, insurance, and props add up fast, and every one is a deductible cost. You need to capture them without keeping a shoebox of receipts.</li>
<li><strong>Travel and mileage awareness.</strong> You drive to venues and shoots, and that travel is a real business cost. Some tools track mileage automatically; others need you to log travel as an expense yourself.</li>
<li><strong>Handling irregular, seasonal income.</strong> Your months are lumpy. Software that shows income and expenses over time helps you plan for the slow season instead of being surprised by it.</li>
<li><strong>Keeping personal and business money apart.</strong> When one card pays for both a lens and groceries, you need a clean way to record only the business side.</li>
<li><strong>Tax-ready reports.</strong> At year-end you want a profit and loss statement and a tidy record of income and expenses you can hand to an accountant or use to file yourself.</li>
</ul>
<p>Anything beyond this list is a bonus, not a requirement. A tool that nails these six things for a low price will serve most photographers better than an expensive suite you use a tenth of.</p>

      'h2' => 'Invoicing, deposits, and retainers are the heart of it',
      'anchor' => 'invoicing-deposits',
      'html' => <<<'HTML'
<p>For most photographers, invoicing is where accounting software either earns its keep or gets in the way. The booking model is almost always the same: a client pays a deposit or retainer to hold the date, then pays the balance closer to the shoot or on delivery of the gallery. Your software needs to handle that split cleanly.</p>
{{illustration:invoice-doc}}
<p>The right setup lets you send a professional invoice with your logo, record the deposit against the booking, and show the remaining balance so you always know who still owes you. That matters more than it sounds. When you've got a dozen weddings on the calendar, each with a deposit paid and a balance due, a system that tracks the outstanding amount per client is the difference between getting paid on time and chasing money you forgot about.</p>
<p>Argo Books handles this part well. You can build and send invoices, take payments, record deposits, and see outstanding balances, without any accounting background. The one live payment integration is Stripe, so if you collect card payments through Stripe you can import those sales, fees, and customers directly. If you take deposits by bank transfer or another method, you record them yourself, which is a minute of work per booking. For a deeper look at what to put on a photography invoice and when to send it, our guide on <a href="/best-invoicing-software-for-small-business/">invoicing software for small business</a> covers the general ground.</p>

      'h2' => 'Tracking gear, expenses, and receipts',
      'anchor' => 'gear-expenses',
      'html' => <<<'HTML'
<p>Photography is a gear-heavy business, and gear is expensive. A single lens can cost more than a month of some people's rent, and that's before bodies, lighting, memory cards, editing software subscriptions, insurance, backups, and the props or rentals a shoot needs. Every one of those is a legitimate business expense, and every expense you fail to record is money you overpay in tax.</p>
{{illustration:receipt-scan}}
<p>The practical problem is capture. You buy gear online, in shops, and on the road, and the receipts scatter. Good software makes recording them almost effortless. Argo Books scans a receipt and turns it into an expense for you, so a purchase gets logged in seconds instead of piling up in a drawer. On the free tier you get 10 receipt scans a month, and Premium raises that to 500, which is plenty even in a heavy buying month.</p>
<p>One nuance worth knowing: big-ticket gear like a camera body may be treated as a capital asset that you write off over several years rather than a one-time expense, depending on your country's tax rules and the amount. That's a conversation for your accountant, but the bookkeeping habit is the same either way: record the purchase, keep the receipt, and let your software hold the record so nothing slips through. Small items like cards, filters, and consumables are usually straightforward expenses.</p>

      'h2' => 'Travel and mileage: know how your tool handles it',
      'anchor' => 'travel-mileage',
      'html' => <<<'HTML'
<p>Photographers drive. You go to venues, to clients' homes, to scout locations, to markets and events. In many tax systems that business travel is deductible, either as a per-kilometre or per-mile rate or as actual vehicle costs, and over a busy year it can add up to a meaningful deduction. So how your software handles travel genuinely matters.</p>
<p>Here's an honest point that shapes the software choice: some tools have built-in automatic mileage tracking, usually a phone app that senses when you're driving and logs the trip in the background. Argo Books does not do this. It's a desktop app that works offline, and it does not automatically track your mileage. What you do instead is log your travel as an expense yourself, recording the trip and its cost the same way you'd record any other expense. That's a small manual step, and for a lot of photographers it's completely fine, especially if you keep a simple note of trips in your phone and enter them when you do your monthly books.</p>
<p>But be honest with yourself about your own habits. If you drive constantly and know you'll never remember to log trips by hand, a tool with automatic mileage tracking might save you real money in captured deductions. That's a fair reason to weigh it in the mix. It's worth being clear-eyed about, because the best software is the one whose workflow you'll actually keep up with.</p>

      'h2' => 'Irregular income and separating personal from business',
      'anchor' => 'seasonal-income',
      'html' => <<<'HTML'
<p>Two things make a photographer's finances messier than a steady salaried job, and good software helps with both.</p>
{{illustration:cashflow-cycle}}
<p><strong>Seasonal, lumpy income.</strong> Weddings cluster in summer, portraits pick up before the holidays, and January can be dead quiet. If you spend in June like every month is June, February hurts. Software that shows your income and expenses over time lets you see the pattern and set money aside for the slow months and for tax. Argo Books includes a report builder for profit and loss and other views, and its Premium tier adds predictive cash-flow analytics that project where you're heading based on your history. Even without that, simply seeing a few months side by side is enough to plan.</p>
<p><strong>Mixing personal and business money.</strong> Most solo photographers pay for a lens and their lunch on the same card at some point. The cleanest fix is a separate business bank account, which we'd recommend to any photographer treating this as a real business. But even without one, your software should let you record only the business side of your spending. Argo imports your data from a CSV or bank statement so you can enter the business transactions and leave the personal ones out. Worth being clear on: that's an import, not a live bank feed. You bring the statement in when you do your books, rather than transactions flowing in automatically. For a lot of photographers, doing this once a month is a perfectly good rhythm.</p>

      'h2' => 'Where Argo Books fits, and where it doesn\'t',
      'anchor' => 'where-argo-fits',
      'html' => <<<'HTML'
<p>Let's be straight about who Argo Books suits and who should look elsewhere, because pretending one tool is right for everyone helps nobody.</p>
{{illustration:compare-scale}}
<p><strong>Argo is a strong fit if</strong> you want something cheap, simple, and private that does your own books without an accounting background. It's free to start, and Premium is $15 a month or $150 a year in Canadian dollars, which undercuts most of the well-known names. It's a desktop app for Windows, Mac, and Linux that works offline, so your financial data lives on your own machine rather than only in someone's cloud, which a lot of photographers like. The invoicing with deposits is genuinely good, receipt scanning makes gear tracking painless, and the report builder gives you tax-ready profit and loss and other reports. The free tier caps you at 25 invoices and 10 receipt scans a month; Premium lifts those to unlimited invoices and 500 scans.</p>
<p><strong>You might prefer something else if</strong> you rely on automatic mileage tracking and won't log trips by hand, since Argo doesn't track mileage for you. The same goes if you want your client galleries, booking, contracts, and payments all combined in one photography-specific platform, several of which exist and are built around the shoot-to-delivery workflow rather than the books. And if you need a continuous live bank feed or deep payroll for a studio with staff, a bigger cloud suite will fit better. Argo imports data rather than syncing live, and Stripe is its only live third-party integration. None of that is a knock, it's just honest scope. More integrations are planned, but we won't promise specific ones or dates.</p>
<p>For the many photographers who do their own books, want to keep costs down, and value owning their data offline, Argo covers the essentials well. For those whose deal-breaker is automatic mileage or an all-in-one gallery-and-payments platform, it's fair to look at a specialist tool instead.</p>

      'h2' => 'How to choose: a short checklist',
      'anchor' => 'how-to-choose',
      'html' => <<<'HTML'
<p>You don't need to test ten products. Run any candidate through these questions and the shortlist gets small fast.</p>
{{illustration:checklist}}
<ol>
<li><strong>Can it invoice with deposits and retainers cleanly?</strong> This is the daily-use feature for most photographers, so it has to be easy.</li>
<li><strong>How does it capture expenses and receipts?</strong> If logging gear is painful, you'll skip it and lose deductions. Receipt scanning is a real time-saver here.</li>
<li><strong>How does it handle travel?</strong> Decide honestly whether you'll log trips by hand or need automatic mileage tracking, and pick accordingly.</li>
<li><strong>Does it show your money over time?</strong> Seasonal income means you want to see the shape of your year, not just this month.</li>
<li><strong>What does it cost, and is there a free tier?</strong> Try before you pay. A free start lets you see if the workflow suits you with no risk.</li>
<li><strong>Where does your data live?</strong> If you care about owning your data offline versus cloud-only, decide that up front.</li>
<li><strong>Will it give you tax-ready reports?</strong> A profit and loss statement and a clean income-and-expense record are what you or your accountant need at year-end. Remember that no tool files or remits your taxes for you, so confirm the numbers with a professional.</li>
</ol>
<p>Match those answers to your own way of working and the right tool usually picks itself. If cheap, simple, offline, and strong on invoicing describes what you want, Argo Books is worth a look. If your must-have is automatic mileage or an all-in-one gallery platform, weigh a specialist instead. Either way, the best software is the one you'll actually keep up with, because books you maintain beat a fancier tool you abandon by March.</p>
