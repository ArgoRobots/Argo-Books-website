      <h2>Why dividing salary by hours gives the wrong answer</h2>
      <p>The instinct when going self-employed is to take the salary you want, divide by roughly 2,000 hours, and quote that. It produces a number that feels reasonable and cannot possibly work.</p>
      <p class="calc-formula">Rate = (take-home &divide; (1 &minus; tax) + business costs) &divide; billable hours</p>
      <p>Three things sit between the hours you work and the money you keep:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>You cannot bill every hour.</strong> Quoting, invoicing, chasing late payers, buying materials, driving between jobs, marketing, and bookkeeping are unpaid. For most people the billable share is between 55% and 80%.</li>
        <li><strong>The business has costs.</strong> Insurance, tools, software, an accountant, a vehicle, a phone. As an employee somebody else bought all of that.</li>
        <li><strong>Tax comes out afterwards.</strong> Nobody is withholding it for you, so a rate that ignores tax leaves you with a bill you have already spent.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>A worked example</h2>
      <div class="calc-example">
        <p>You want <strong>$60,000</strong> in your pocket. Business costs run <strong>$12,000</strong> a year. You work 40 hours a week, take 6 weeks off, bill 60% of your time, and pay about 25% in tax.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Working weeks: <strong>46</strong>. Hours worked: <strong>1,840</strong>. Billable: <strong>1,104</strong>.</li>
          <li>To keep $60,000 after 25% tax you must earn <strong>$80,000</strong> before it.</li>
          <li>Plus $12,000 of costs: you need to bill <strong>$92,000</strong>.</li>
          <li><strong>$92,000 &divide; 1,104 = $83.33 an hour.</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p>The naive calculation, $60,000 divided by 1,840 hours worked, gives <strong>$32.61</strong>. Charging that would leave you roughly <strong>$27,000</strong> short of your target before you had noticed anything was wrong.</p>
      </div>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Being honest about billable hours</h2>
      <p>This input moves the answer more than any other, and almost everyone overstates it.</p>
      <div class="calc-table-wrap">
        <table class="calc-table">
          <thead><tr><th scope="col">Type of work</th><th scope="col">Typically billable</th><th scope="col">Where the rest goes</th></tr></thead>
          <tbody>
            <?php foreach ($profiles as $p): ?>
              <tr>
                <td><?= htmlspecialchars($p['name']) ?></td>
                <td><?= (int)$p['billable'] ?>%</td>
                <td><?= htmlspecialchars($p['note']) ?></td>
              </tr>
            <?php endforeach; ?>
          </tbody>
        </table>
      </div>
      <p>If you want a real figure rather than an estimate, track one ordinary fortnight. Write down every hour and mark it billable or not. The result is usually sobering and it makes every future pricing decision better.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>What to do when the number feels too high</h2>
      <p>The calculator will often produce a rate above what you have been charging. That is the point, but it is not always the whole story, and there are four honest responses.</p>
      <ol class="calc-list">
        <li><strong>Raise the billable percentage.</strong> Better systems for quoting, invoicing, and scheduling convert unpaid hours into paid ones. Going from 55% to 65% cuts your required rate by roughly 15%.</li>
        <li><strong>Cut a real cost.</strong> Look at subscriptions, insurance, and vehicle costs. Small annual figures move the hourly rate less than people expect, but they compound.</li>
        <li><strong>Work more weeks, deliberately.</strong> Taking four weeks off instead of eight lowers the rate you need. Do this with your eyes open rather than by accident.</li>
        <li><strong>Change what you sell.</strong> Move from hours to outcomes, packages, or retainers so the price reflects the value rather than the clock.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>What is not on the list is dropping your take-home target to make the arithmetic comfortable. That is not a pricing decision, it is a pay cut you have chosen not to notice.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Hourly, day rate, or fixed price?</h2>
      <p>Work out the hourly number first regardless, because it is the floor everything else has to clear.</p>
      <p><strong>Day rates</strong> suit work that fills a day anyway and stop the argument about half hours. <strong>Fixed prices</strong> reward you for getting faster, which hourly billing punishes, but they carry the risk if a job runs long. <strong>Retainers</strong> smooth your income and are worth a discount against your hourly rate because they remove the gaps.</p>
      <p>Whichever you quote, check it against the hourly figure. If a fixed price divided by the hours it will really take comes out below your number, it is a job that costs you money to accept.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Where a calculator stops helping</h2>
      <p>This gives you a rate from figures you estimated. Next year you should be using figures you actually measured: what your costs really were, how many hours you really billed, and what you really took home.</p>
      <p><a class="calc-link" href="<?= INVGEN_BASE ?>/features/expense-revenue-tracking/<?= $ref_qs ?>&amp;placement=content">Argo Books</a> records your income and expenses so that number comes from your books rather than a guess, and shows whether the rate you set is actually delivering. It runs on your own computer and it is free to start.</p>
