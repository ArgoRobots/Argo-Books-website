    <section>
      <h2>How much should you charge for a candle?</h2>
      <p>The honest answer is that nobody can tell you without your numbers, because a candle maker buying wax by the case in bulk has a completely different cost base to one buying 10lb bags. What everyone shares is the method.</p>
      <p class="calc-formula">Price = (materials &divide; batch size + your time + selling costs) &times; (1 + markup)</p>
      <p>Most handmade candle makers selling direct use a markup between <strong>150% and 250%</strong>, which leaves a profit margin of 60% to 71%. That sounds enormous until you remember the markup has to cover the hours you spent, the jars that arrived cracked, the fragrance that did not throw, and the fees taken out of every sale.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Getting your wax cost right</h2>
      <p>This is where most candle pricing goes wrong, so it is worth doing carefully once.</p>
      <p>Vessel size and wax weight are not the same number. A jar described as 8oz holds 8 fluid ounces of water, but the wax that fills it weighs less than that, and how much less depends on the wax. Do not estimate it.</p>
      <p>Instead, pour one candle and weigh the wax you actually used. Then work out the cost per ounce of your wax, and multiply:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>A 10lb bag of wax is 160oz. At $40 a bag, that is <strong>$0.25 an ounce</strong>.</li>
        <li>Your test candle used 6.2oz of wax, so wax costs <strong>$1.55</strong> per candle.</li>
        <li>Twelve candles a batch means <strong>$18.60</strong> of wax in the batch materials.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Do the same for fragrance. Your wax has a maximum fragrance load, usually printed on the bag or the supplier's page, and the percentage you use is by weight of wax. Weigh what you pour rather than counting bottles.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>The costs candle makers forget</h2>
      <ol class="calc-list">
        <li><strong>Wick stickers, centring bars, and warning labels.</strong> Individually trivial, but they are on every candle you make, and together they are often more than the dye.</li>
        <li><strong>The candles you cannot sell.</strong> Frosting, sinkholes, wet spots, a fragrance that seized. Build a little slack into your markup rather than pretending every pour is sellable.</li>
        <li><strong>Curing space and time.</strong> Not a cash cost, but a real one if your batch ties up a room for two weeks before it can ship.</li>
        <li><strong>Shipping supplies.</strong> Candle mailers are not cheap and glass needs protecting. If you ship, that belongs in your selling costs.</li>
        <li><strong>Sample and testing burns.</strong> Every new fragrance costs you at least one candle you will never sell.</li>
      </ol>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>A worked example</h2>
      <div class="calc-example">
        <p>A batch of <strong>12</strong> eight-ounce soy candles:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Wax: <strong>$18.60</strong>. Wicks and stickers: <strong>$3.00</strong>. Jars with lids: <strong>$26.40</strong>. Fragrance: <strong>$11.00</strong>. Labels and boxes: <strong>$7.20</strong>.</li>
          <li>Batch materials: <strong>$66.20</strong>, so <strong>$5.52</strong> per candle.</li>
          <li>The batch takes about three hours all in, so 15 minutes a candle. At $20 an hour that is <strong>$5.00</strong> of your time.</li>
          <li>Etsy fees and a padded mailer come to about <strong>$1.80</strong> a candle.</li>
          <li><strong>True cost per candle: $12.32.</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p>At a 150% markup that candle sells for <strong>$30.80</strong> and leaves you <strong>$18.48</strong>. At the $22 a lot of makers guess at, you would be earning <strong>$9.68</strong>, and after your own time that is closer to $4.68 an hour of actual profit.</p>
      </div>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Pricing different sizes</h2>
      <p>Do not scale the price with the wax. A 4oz tin uses less wax and less fragrance than an 8oz jar, but it needs the same wick trimming, the same label, the same packing time, and the same listing. Run each size through the calculator on its own.</p>
      <p>You will usually find small sizes need a higher markup to be worth making at all. That is normal, and it is why experienced makers sell small candles mainly as add-ons, gift sets, and market impulse buys rather than as the main product.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Markup or margin?</h2>
      <p>These get mixed up constantly, and the difference is money.</p>
      <p class="calc-formula">Markup is on top of your cost. Margin is a share of your price.</p>
      <p>Doubling your cost is a <strong>100% markup</strong> but only a <strong>50% margin</strong>. A 150% markup is a 60% margin. If you have been told to aim for a 60% margin and you have been adding 60% to your cost, you have been leaving roughly a quarter of your price on the table on every candle. The calculator shows both so you can see which one you are actually setting.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>When one candle stops being the question</h2>
      <p>A calculator prices one product. It cannot tell you whether the shop as a whole made money last quarter, which fragrances actually sell, or what you spent on supplies across the year. Once you are pouring every week, those are the questions that matter, and they are hard to answer from a shoebox of receipts.</p>
      <p>That is where <a class="calc-link" href="<?= INVGEN_BASE ?>/features/expense-revenue-tracking/<?= $ref_qs ?>&amp;placement=content">Argo Books</a> comes in: it records your supply runs and your sales, keeps fees as their own category, and shows your real profit month by month. It runs on your own computer and it is free to start.</p>
