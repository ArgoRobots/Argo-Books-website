/**
 * Receipt-scan quota: identity resolution and atomic consumption.
 *
 * Two endpoints need to agree about this, and they must agree exactly:
 *
 *   - usage.php answers the app's "how many do I have left?" question, and is what
 *     the desktop UI shows and gates its bulk-scan batch on.
 *   - completions.php spends the quota, because that is the request that actually
 *     costs money at Gemini.
 *
 * They key the same table row, so the identifier mapping lives here rather than in
 * either one. If they ever computed it differently the app would report one balance
 * and the server would enforce against another, which reads as the limit firing at
 * random.
 *
 * Why the spend moved here at all: the limit used to be enforced entirely by the
 * client choosing to call usage.php's increment after a successful scan. A client
 * that skipped the call, or simply sent more requests than it had reported, was
 * unmetered. Consuming inside the request that spends the money closes that.
 *
 * Requires a live $pdo and config/pricing.php to be loadable.
