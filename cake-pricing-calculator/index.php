      <h2>How much should you charge for a cake?</h2>
      <p>Most home bakers price a cake by feel, land somewhere near what the supermarket charges, and then wonder why an order that took a whole Saturday left them with $30.</p>
      <p class="calc-formula">Price = (ingredients + board and box + your time + kitchen costs) &times; (1 + markup)</p>
      <p>The decorating time is what separates a home baker's cake from a supermarket one, and it is exactly the thing that gets left out of the price. A three-hour decorating job at a modest $25 an hour is <strong>$75 of labour</strong> before a single ingredient is counted.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Costing your ingredients once, properly</h2>
      <p>You only need to do this once. Sit down with your usual recipe and work out the cost of what it actually consumes, not what the packets cost.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>A $4 bag of flour holding about 16 cups is <strong>$0.25 a cup</strong>.</li>
        <li>A dozen eggs at $5 is <strong>$0.42 an egg</strong>.</li>
        <li>A $6 block of butter at 4 sticks is <strong>$1.50 a stick</strong>.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Write the per-unit costs on a card and keep it with your recipes. A standard two-layer 8-inch sponge usually comes to somewhere between $8 and $14 of batter and buttercream, which is almost always less than bakers guess, and almost always dwarfed by the decorating time they forgot to count.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>A worked example</h2>
      <div class="calc-example">
        <p>An 8-inch two-layer birthday cake with buttercream and a simple piped design:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Batter: <strong>$9.20</strong>. Filling and frosting: <strong>$7.40</strong>. Decorations and topper: <strong>$5.00</strong>. Board and box: <strong>$3.80</strong>.</li>
          <li>Materials: <strong>$25.40</strong>.</li>
          <li>Three hours of prep, baking, and decorating at $25 an hour: <strong>$75.00</strong>.</li>
          <li>Oven electricity, insurance share, and card fees: <strong>$6.00</strong>.</li>
          <li><strong>True cost: $106.40.</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p>At a 150% markup the cake is <strong>$266</strong>, which is well above the market for a simple birthday cake. That is the calculator doing its job: it is telling you three hours is too long for this design at this price point. Either the design has to get faster, or it has to be sold as bespoke work to someone who wants exactly that. At <strong>$130</strong> the cake still covers costs and pays you your $25 an hour, but leaves almost nothing on top, which is a decision you should make knowingly rather than by accident.</p>
      </div>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>The costs bakers leave out</h2>
      <ol class="calc-list">
        <li><strong>Consultation and messaging time.</strong> Twenty messages about shades of pink is real work. Build it into your markup or charge a design fee on bespoke orders.</li>
        <li><strong>Tastings and samples.</strong> Especially for weddings. Someone pays for those, and right now it is you.</li>
        <li><strong>The cake that failed.</strong> A collapsed sponge on the morning of the order costs you the ingredients twice and the time twice.</li>
        <li><strong>Equipment wear.</strong> Tips, moulds, cutters, and pans get replaced. Spread a little of that into your kitchen costs.</li>
        <li><strong>Licensing and insurance.</strong> An annual cost that belongs spread across your cakes, not absorbed silently.</li>
      </ol>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Per-serving pricing, and why it misleads</h2>
      <p>"Charge $4 to $6 a serving" is the most repeated advice in cake groups and the least useful, because a serving is not a unit of work. A sheet cake serving 40 people with a plain frosted top is far less work than a two-tier serving 30 with hand-piped detail, yet per-serving pricing charges more for the easy one.</p>
      <p>Work out your real price from cost and time, then divide by servings afterwards to sanity check where you have landed against local rates. Use the per-serving number as a mirror, never as the method.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Cottage food rules are worth ten minutes of your time</h2>
      <p>Selling food from a home kitchen is regulated nearly everywhere, and the rules differ by country, state, and sometimes county. They typically cover which foods you may sell, whether you can post them or only sell in person, what has to be on the label, and the earnings ceiling before a commercial kitchen is required.</p>
      <p>Look up your local food authority before your first paid order. The requirements are usually modest, and the consequences of skipping them are not.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>When one cake stops being the question</h2>
      <p>A calculator prices one order. It cannot tell you whether the month made money, which cakes are worth the effort, or what you spent on ingredients across the year. Once orders are regular, those are the questions that decide whether this is a business or an expensive hobby.</p>
