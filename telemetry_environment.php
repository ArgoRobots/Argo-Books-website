/**
 * Which environment a telemetry install belongs to.
 *
 * One database sits behind both argorobots.com and dev.argorobots.com, and the
 * telemetry auth path does not filter on the environment column: a sandbox
 * subscription authenticates against production and its uploads land in
 * production's data-logs. Nothing inside an uploaded file records where it came
 * from, so the only evidence is the subscription the install authenticated as.
 *
 * Premium authIds are 'subscription:<subscription_id>'. An id that is not in
 * premium_subscriptions for the current environment is not this environment's, and
 * that covers both a sandbox subscription and one that has since been deleted:
 * either way there is no live account here to attribute the install to.
 *
 * Free authIds are 'device:<hash>', a bare SHA-256 of a device id with no row
 * behind it, so a free install from a dev machine cannot be told apart from a real
 * one. Those have to be listed in FOUNDER_AUTH_IDS instead: see founder_identity.php.
 *
 * Requires the global $pdo and current_environment() from db_connect.php.
