 * Drains queued admin-composed broadcasts (marketing_broadcasts) by sending a
 * capped batch of pending recipients per run. Resumable and rate-limit friendly:
 * if a broadcast has more recipients than the per-run cap, the next run picks up
 * where this one left off. Each recipient is re-checked against the send-time gate
 * (should_send_marketing_email) so anyone who unsubscribed after the broadcast was
 * queued is skipped, not emailed.
 *
 * Schedule: every 5 minutes.
