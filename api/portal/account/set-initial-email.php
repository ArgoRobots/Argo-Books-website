/**
 * POST /api/portal/account/set-initial-email.php
 * Body: { email }
 *
 * Begins first-time owner email setup for a portal company that currently
 * has none. This is the "complete registration" path for accounts that
 * registered with an empty email. The email is NOT written to owner_email
 * here: it is held as a pending value on the email_verifications row, and a
 * 6-digit verification code is emailed to it. Only when the caller confirms
 * the code via /verify-email/confirm.php does owner_email get set (along
 * with email_verified_at).
 *
 * Why this design: a typo in the typed email (or a malicious attacker
 * setting an email they don't actually own) shouldn't stick. If the user
 * abandons verification, nothing is set and they can simply retry with a
 * corrected address. The matching VerifyEmailModal on the desktop pops
 * automatically after this endpoint succeeds.
 *
 * Refuses (409) if owner_email is already set: in that case, the caller must
 * use the 4-step email-change flow which verifies both old and new addresses.
