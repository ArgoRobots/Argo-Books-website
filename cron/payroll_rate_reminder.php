/**
 * payroll_rate_reminder.php
 *
 * Emails the admin that CRA's payroll deduction tables are about to change, so a new rate
 * file can be prepared and uploaded before it takes effect.
 *
 * CRA publishes twice a year, effective January 1 and July 1. The app refuses to calculate a
 * pay run when it holds no edition covering that pay date, and never falls back to the
 * previous one, so a missed deadline does not produce wrong deductions: it stops payroll
 * working at all until a new file ships. That is a loud failure rather than a silent one, but it still lands on every
 * customer at once, on a date fixed by CRA, which is what this reminder exists to prevent.
 *
 * Sent from the 10th to the 20th of December and June, roughly two weeks of lead time. Sends
 * once per window, tracked in cron_runs, so a daily schedule does not produce eleven emails.
 *
 * Always sent. There is no preference to disable it: the whole point is that it arrives in a
 * month when payroll is not on anyone's mind.
 *
 * Schedule: daily.

    <p>Full instructions, including where to get the numbers and how to verify them, are in

    <p>Rough steps:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Get the new figures from CRA\'s T4127 guide and the CPP, CPP2 and EI rate pages.
            CRA publishes an edition about a month before it takes effect, so they are already
            out.</li>
        <li>Check every derived maximum reproduces from its own rate.</li>
        <li>Build <code>' . $safeEdition . '.json</code> and check it against CRA\'s calculator.</li>
        <li>Upload it to <code>resources/downloads/payroll/</code> on this server. Existing
            installs fetch it from there, so this is the step that reaches customers without a
            release. The app validates it and ignores anything that fails, so check it first:
            a rejected file is silent.</li>
        <li>Also commit it to <code>ArgoBooks.Core/Resources/Payroll/</code>, so a fresh install
            has it offline rather than needing to reach the server before it can run payroll.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>This email stops once <code>' . $safeEdition . '.json</code> is on the server. If you get
    the three day warning, the upload has not happened.</p>
