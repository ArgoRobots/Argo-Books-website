            <p>Learn how to create categories and manage products in Argo Books.</p>

            <h2>Expense Side and Revenue Side</h2>
            <p>Argo Books keeps the things you <em>buy</em> separate from the things you <em>sell</em>. That is why the sidebar has two of each:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Expense categories</strong> and <strong>Expense products</strong>, under the Expenses section, for what you purchase</li>
                <li><strong>Revenue categories</strong> and <strong>Revenue products</strong>, under the Revenue section, for what you sell</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The two pages work identically. Which one you use decides whether the item shows up when you record an expense or when you record a revenue entry. Rental items have their own category type and live under Rentals.</p>

            <h2>Why Categories Matter</h2>
            <p>Categories are the foundation of how Argo Books organizes your data. Every product belongs to a category. By grouping products into categories, you can:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Track spending by area:</strong> See how much you're spending on "Office Supplies" vs "Raw Materials" at a glance</li>
                <li><strong>Generate meaningful reports:</strong> Reports and analytics break down data by category, giving you actionable insights</li>
                <li><strong>Stay organized as you grow:</strong> As your product catalog grows, categories keep everything manageable</li>
            </ul>
            <p>For example, a bakery might create expense categories like "Ingredients," "Packaging," and "Equipment" to track different types of spending separately, and revenue categories like "Bread," "Cakes," and "Catering" for what it sells.</p>

            <h2>Creating Categories</h2>
            <ol class="steps-list">
                <li>Go to "Expense categories" or "Revenue categories" in the sidebar</li>
                <li>Click "Add Category"</li>
                <li>Enter the category name</li>
                <li>Optionally add a description, pick a colour and an emoji icon so it stands out in lists and charts</li>
                <li>Optionally choose a parent category to nest it underneath an existing one</li>
                <li>Save the category</li>
            </ol>

            <div class="info-box">
                <strong>Tip:</strong> Create your categories before adding products. This makes it easier to assign each product to the right category as you go.
            </div>

            <h2>Adding Products</h2>
            <ol class="steps-list">
                <li>Go to "Expense products" or "Revenue products" in the sidebar</li>
                <li>Click "Add Product"</li>
                <li>Enter the product name</li>
                <li>Select a category</li>
                <li>Fill in any other details (SKU, pricing, supplier, inventory thresholds)</li>
                <li>Save the product</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>Product Fields</h2>
            <p>When adding or editing a product, you can set the following:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Name:</strong> The product or service name</li>
                <li><strong>SKU:</strong> Your own stock code, used for searching and shown on stock levels</li>
                <li><strong>Item Type:</strong> Whether this is a Product or a Service</li>
                <li><strong>Category:</strong> Which category the product belongs to</li>
                <li><strong>Supplier:</strong> The vendor you purchase this product from</li>
                <li><strong>Description:</strong> Additional notes about the product</li>
                <li><strong>Unit Price:</strong> The default price used when you add this item to a transaction or invoice</li>
                <li><strong>Cost Price:</strong> What the item costs you, as a reference figure</li>
                <li><strong>Tax Rate:</strong> The default tax rate applied when the item is used</li>
                <li><strong>Track Inventory:</strong> Whether stock levels are kept for this item</li>
                <li><strong>Reorder Point:</strong> Minimum stock level before a low-stock alert is triggered</li>
                <li><strong>Overstock Threshold:</strong> Maximum stock level before an overstock alert appears</li>
                <li><strong>Status:</strong> Active or inactive, so retired items stay in your history without cluttering the picker</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="info-box">
                <strong>Note:</strong> Unit price, cost price and tax rate are defaults, not fixed values. You can change any of them on an individual transaction or invoice line without editing the product.
            </div>

            <h2>Managing Existing Products</h2>
            <p>From either products page, you can edit or delete any product using the action buttons. Changes to a product's details (like category or description) apply going forward and do not modify past transactions.</p>

            <div class="info-box">
                <strong>Reporting:</strong> Argo Books reports revenue per product, not profit per product, because there is often no reliable cost for a specific item sold. <a class="link" href="../reference/how-numbers-are-calculated.php#sales-by-product">How Numbers Are Calculated</a> explains the reasoning.
            </div>
