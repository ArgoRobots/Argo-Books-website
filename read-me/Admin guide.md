# Payment System - Admin Guide

## Payment Processor Fees

Every online payment — whether it's a customer paying an invoice through the Payment Portal or a customer buying an Argo Premium subscription — adds **2.9% + \$0.30 CAD** on top of the base amount. That's the same number no matter which provider (Stripe, PayPal, or Square), no matter the country. It's hardcoded — set in `.env` via `PROCESSING_FEE_PERCENT` and `PROCESSING_FEE_FIXED`.

Who actually pays the fee depends on the flow:

- **Argo Premium subscriptions:** the customer always pays it. They see `$10.00 + $0.59` (or whatever the base price + fee works out to) at checkout.
- **Invoices sent through the Payment Portal:** the merchant decides per invoice via the "pass processing fee" toggle:
  - **Toggle on** → the merchant passes the cost on to the customer. Customer pays invoice total + 2.9% + \$0.30.
  - **Toggle off** → customer pays just the invoice total. The merchant absorbs the cost.

Argo Books, and the companies using Argo Books pay these fees when they move the money out of their Stripe/PayPal/Square account and into their normal bank account. Below are the rates that the payment providers charge:

### Stripe

- **Standard Rate:** 2.9% + \$0.30 CAD per transaction

- **Currency Conversion:** Additional 1%

### PayPal

- **International:** 4.4% + fixed fee

### Square
