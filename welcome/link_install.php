 * Links a fresh install to the browser session that downloaded it.

 * The desktop app opens /welcome/?m=<machine_uuid> in the default browser on its
 * first run. That browser still carries the argo_visitor_id cookie from the visit
 * that produced the download, so this request is the one moment where the machine
 * and the visitor are both identifiable. Matching them here is exact: no guessing
 * from IP addresses or timing.
 *
 * This exists because macOS gives no other route. Windows recovers the token from
 * the installer filename and Linux from the AppImage filename, but a Mac download
 * is a .zip the browser auto-expands, and the extracted "Argo Books.app" carries
 * neither the archive's name nor any record of where it came from: recent macOS
 * stopped storing the source URL in the quarantine event, so there is nothing on
 * disk left to read.
 *
 * Only rows that are still unattributed are touched, so a token match always wins
 * and a second visit cannot overwrite or reassign an existing attribution.
