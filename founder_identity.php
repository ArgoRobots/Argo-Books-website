/**
 * Founder identity — the single source of truth for "which app installs are the
 * founder's own", so the founder's own testing never pollutes app telemetry,
 * crash reports, or the app-stats dashboards.
 *
 * Identities are the telemetry/crash authIds the desktop endpoints authenticate
 * as: 'subscription:PREM-...' for premium installs, 'device:<hash>' for free ones.
 * They are configured ONCE in .env as FOUNDER_AUTH_IDS (comma-separated) and read
 * only through this helper, so there is one place to manage them.
 *
 * Scope: this covers the app-data pipelines (telemetry + crashes) only. Website
 * page-view / referral exclusion is a separate, IP-based mechanism configured via
 * EXCLUDED_TRACKING_IPS and enforced by is_nontracked_ip() in statistics.php.
 *
 * Founder data is KEPT, not discarded. api/data/upload.php and api/data/crash.php
 * write it to disk like anyone else's, and the read side decides what to do with it:
 *
 *   - admin/app-stats/index.php, crashes-tab.php and admin/marketing-funnel skip it,
 *     so it never reaches a chart, a KPI card, or a funnel count.
 *   - admin/app-stats/user-activity-tab.php is the ONE place it surfaces, badged as
 *     the founder's own install and left out of the user tally.
 *
 * Requires .env to already be loaded (callers load it via Dotenv or db_connect).
