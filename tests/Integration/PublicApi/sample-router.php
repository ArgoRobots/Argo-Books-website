 * Router for the throwaway PHP server the documentation-sample tests run
 * against. It stands in for the .htaccess rewrite, which the built-in server
 * does not read, so /v1/... reaches the same front controller it would in
 * production.
 *
 * The server is a separate process from PHPUnit, so it would otherwise load
 * .env and talk to the development database, while the tests create their key
 * in the test database. Loading .env.testing first fixes that: db_connect.php
 * loads .env with createImmutable, which by phpdotenv's contract will not
 * overwrite anything already set here. Same trick as tests/bootstrap.php.
