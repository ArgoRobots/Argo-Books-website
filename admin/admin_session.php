/**
 * Shared admin session bootstrap.
 *
 * Every admin entry point includes this INSTEAD of calling session_start()
 * directly, so the admin login is configured identically everywhere and no
 * longer depends on the live host's php.ini.
 *
 * Why this exists: on the production server the default
 * session.gc_maxlifetime was short enough that admins were logged out after a
 * few minutes of inactivity. This bootstrap fixes that by:
 *   1. Setting the admin session lifetime in code (8 hours), so idle time no
 *      longer relies on the host default.
 *   2. Storing admin sessions in a private directory, so another app's
 *      short-lifetime garbage collection (or a host cron sweeping the default
 *      session dir) can't delete them early. Falls back to the default path if
 *      that directory can't be created or written, so login never breaks.
 *   3. Using a dedicated cookie name, so the public site's session (a community
 *      login regenerating its id, for example) can't disturb an admin session.
 *
 * Include this before any output. Replaces the inline cookie-params + start
 * block that admin/login.php used to carry.
